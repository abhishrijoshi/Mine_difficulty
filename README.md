##What it does and why

What is difficulty ?
it is the difficulty to mine a block

If its too much i get less crypto

It changes based on number of minners and various other thing
so if the difficulty is above 1075 M i get very less crypto and the crypto is just not worth the money i am investing to mine it
the cost of electricity and things
so i am cheaking the difficulty and if its less then 1075 i mine and its profitable  , if its more then 1075 its not profitable for me to mine so its not profitable
As i told you it changes based on things just like the value of crypto so this script checks the difficuly if its more it kills my rig if its less starts my rig 

##Things needed 
1.THis pool 
2.This minner
3.jq
4.awk
5.common sense 
6.Works really good with dmenu  (optional)
